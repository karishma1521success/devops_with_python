#What is Shell Script ?
#  A shell script is a list of commands in a computer program that is run by the Unix shell which is a command-line interpreter.
# A shell script allows you to combine and run multiple commands together unlike terminal which allows only just one command at a time.
# shell script is case sensitive


#Why shell Script?
#To perfom repetitive tasks through automation
# Reduces chances of error


#IMP -- It's always important to start the shell
#using shebang  #!/bin/bash

#Imp -- use ctrl + ~ - to run shell script file in vs code but open git bash terminal not power shell.
# terminal will open and you can execute you shell script file there.

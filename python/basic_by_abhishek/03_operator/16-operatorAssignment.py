#Task1 : Arithmetic operators::: 
# Create two variables a and b with numeric values.
# Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b.
# Print the results.

a = 15
b= 10

sum = a + b
differnce = a-b
product = a*b
quotient = a / b

print(str(sum) , " ", str(differnce) , " ", str(product), " ", str(quotient))


#Task 2 : Comparison Operators
# Compare the values of a and b using the following comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, and !=.
# Print the results of each comparison.

print(a<b)  # False
print(a>b)  # True
print(a<=b) # False
print(a>=b) # True
print(a==b) # False
print(a!=b) # True


# Task 3: Logical Operators
# Create two boolean variables, x and y.
# Use logical operators (and, or, not) to perform various logical operations on x and y.
# Print the results.

x = True
y = False

print(x or y)  # True
print(x and y) # False
print(not x)   # False
print(not y)   # True


# Task 4: Assignment Operators
# Create a variable total and initialize it to 10.
# Use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to update the value of total.
# Print the final value of total.

total = 10
total += 10
total -= 10
total *= 10
total /= 10
print(total)

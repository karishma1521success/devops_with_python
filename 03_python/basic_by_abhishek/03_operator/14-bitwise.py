# Bitwise operators in Python are used to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers.

# Bitwise AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation on the binary representations of the operands.
# Bitwise OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation.
# Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR operation.
# Bitwise NOT (~): Flips the bits of the operand, changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.
# Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
# Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right.


a = 5  # Binary: 0101
b = 3  # Binary: 0011
result = a & b  # Result: 0001 (Decimal: 1)


x = 10  # Binary: 1010
y = 7   # Binary: 0111
result = x | y  # Result: 1111 (Decimal: 15)

# project based on file operations in python
# project server configuration - 
Make a function update server configuration which automatically updates max connections to 500

# file operations include either read or write

read - open file and read file
write - open file, search updated text and write file
So open file is common 
# There is inbuilt function - open(path, r/w) in python to open given path file and r/w - represents either read or write
Syntax - with open(path,''r') as file- for read
         with open(path,'w') as fileVariableName - for write

# steps to perform project

1. open file using open() - inbuilt function in python
# open file and read file (means open file in read mode)
2. search max connections 
3. update max connections to 500
